Invitation to Participate<br>
<br>
You are being asked to take part in a research study. This is not a form of treatment or therapy. It is not supposed to detect a disease or find something wrong. Your participation is voluntary which means you can choose whether on not to participate.<br>
<br>
If you do not understand what you are reading, do not agree to participate.  If you decide to participate, you will be asked to select “I agree to participate in this online study” at the bottom of this form.<br>
<br>
<u>You must be 18 years or older</u> to participate.<br>
<br>
<b>What is the purpose of the study?</b><br>
<br>
Everyday, people must make decisions in an uncertain and changing world. We are studying how people make these kinds of decisions in different contexts.<br>
<br>
<b>How long will I be in the study? How many other people will be in the study?</b><br>
<br>
The study will consist of two games in which you will make decisions under uncertain and changing conditions. Participation in the study consists of one testing session, conducted online, which will last about 40 minutes. You will be one of approximately 50 people in the study.<br>
<br>
<b>What will I be asked to do?</b><br>
<br>
If you decide to participate, the procedure for playing the games will be described to you on the following pages. Both games will involve pressing keys in order to make a decision about what you are shown.<br>
<br>
<b>What are the risks?</b><br>
<br>
There are no known risks associated with this procedure. The testing may be an inconvenience and cause tiredness.<br>
<br>
<b>How will confidentiality be maintained and my privacy be protected?</b><br>
<br>
Confidentiality of your research records will be strictly maintained. Information collected in
this study will remain confidential, except as may be required by court order or by law. No
personal information (such as your name or address) will be collected from you through this
website. When you signed up on the Prolific website, you were given an ID number - this is the only personal information that the research staff will
see.  All collected data is labeled by this code rather than by name or other personal
identifier.  Demographic information about you (e.g. age, race, income) may be retained for
subsequent reporting to funding agencies; this information will also be stored under a code
and not your name. The Prolific website, as well as the Pavlovia
website, are secure websites using the industry-standard method of encrypting and
protecting web communications.  To ensure data security, your data will be stored on the
password-protected computer system in our laboratory.<br>
<br>
The results of this study may be published in a book or journal or used for teaching
purposes. However, you will not be identified by name in any publication or teaching
materials.<br>
<br>
The Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the University of Pennsylvania is responsible for
protecting the rights and welfare of research volunteers like you. Authorized representatives
of the IRB at the University of Pennsylvania will have access to your study records and may
be provided access to research records that identify you by your Prolific
code number and username.<br>
<br>
<b>What happens if I am injured from being in the study?</b><br>
<br>
If you are injured and/or feel upset and emotional discomfort while participating in the study
you may contact the investigator or the emergency contact name on the top of this form.<br>
<br>
<b>Will I be compensated for participating in the study?</b><br>
<br>
To show our appreciation for your time, you will be compensated for your participation. You
will receive $6.50 for completing the study, plus up to $2.25 in bonus pay for good performance.
We find that participants tend to receive about $8 for completing this study.
Please view the specific study information on our Prolific link for the exact details of payment for this study.<br>

	This is an academic research project conducted through the University of Pennsylvania. In this experiment, you will complete two brief games that will require you to make decisions under changing and uncertain conditions. In one, you will see black or white beads being drawn from one of two jars. Your goal will be to predict the color of the bead on the next draw. In the other, you will play a game in which you fly spaceships to different planets to get space treasure.
